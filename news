			<h2 id="5">Looking for logo!<span class="unimportant"> &mdash; by Darkinin at 09/09/13 (Mon) 01:52:56</span></h2>

			<p>Hey, Dark again, and I'd like to say that I am now looking for either an image to make the official logo and favicon for AnimeJunk, or at least content to base it off of.<br/><br/>When I either get enough logos/favicons or ideas for a logo I'll announce such, and either choose the logo somehow or put out another announcement calling for help in creation of the logo.<br/><br/>- Darkinin-kun

			<h2 id="2">Site up and running<span class="unimportant"> &mdash; by Darkinin at 09/08/13 (Sun) 04:36:45</span></h2>

			<p>

			I'd like to thank everyone who waited patiently for me to get the site running, including those who were not already members of AnimeJunk.  I hope the site sticks around for a long time, and that many people will enjoy it and the community<br/><br/> - Darkinin-kun
