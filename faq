				<span class="question">What are Tripcodes?</span>

				<br />

				<p class="answer">

					Tripcodes are hashed strings that serve to show that one post is made by the creator of another post, basically serving as something of a public password to prove the identity of a poster.  They are made by creating a string preceded by either a single hash mark (#) or two (##) into the name field.
				</p>

				<p class="answer">

				Note that use of a single hash tag is considered insecure, as such a tripcode is only hashed once, whereas a tripcode with two hash marks has been hashed twice, and is usually considered to be secure.
